# Auto-Scheduler - a Driving Instructor Schedule Builder

This project was created to help my father, a driving instructor, easily build his weekly work schedule with minimal effort. The goal is to optimize his schedule to allow for more rest time on weekends.

Currently, the project is in its early stages of development. As a result, it may not yet account for all scheduling factors or constraints. These will be clarified and implemented as the project progresses.

Stay tuned for positive updates and improvements! ðŸ˜Š
